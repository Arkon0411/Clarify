## AWS InnoCup Hackathon 2nd RunnerUp
This is a NextJS WebApp deployed using AWS Amplify
 **Clarify** is a real-time, conversational AI that listens during meetings, captures decisions, and automatically delegates tasks.
 It cleans up confusion by turning every discussion into clear, structured actions.

Clarify brings three powerful features:
- Automatic Task Delegator – No more manually assigning tasks. The AI does it based on the conversation.
- Real-Time Conversational AI – Clarify can answer questions during the meeting like, “What did we agree on?”
- Intuitive Dashboard – After the meeting, all tasks, owners, and deadlines are organized in one simple view.

How It Works
- A user joins or creates a call.
- Clarify listens and transcribes the meeting in real time.
- If someone asks for context, the AI summarizes what the team is discussing.
- After the meeting, Clarify automatically delegates tasks based on decisions made.
- If a team member wants something changed, they can send a quick request for adjustment.
